<p>Yasin Burak Kalkan | <strong>Front-End Developer at Medyasoft. from Turkey.</strong></p>
<p>Someone who tries to do <strong>quality work</strong>, not fast jobs, and thinks that quality is hidden in <strong>small details</strong>, not in design. Someone who tries to <strong>be different</strong> from them, not like everyone else.</p>
<p>Someone who thinks that being an <strong>expert</strong> on a subject is better than having an opinion on everything. Someone who thinks that if quality jobs are desired, it is necessary to work with <strong>qualified</strong> people.</p>
<p>It's me.</p>
<p>If you want quality projects, <a href="mailto:yasinburakkalkan@gmail.com">contact me</a>.</p>
